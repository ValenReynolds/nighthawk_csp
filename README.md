# Valen's Trimester-3 Work

## WIKI Overview Of Work
https://github.com/ValenReynolds/nighthawk_csp/wiki/TT3-Assignment 

##TT3 Challenges/Hacks:
* Hack #1 Added Phone Number to Sign Up screen
* Hack #2 Added logout to CRUD screen.
* Hack #3 Added a login required to Fibonacci page

## Additional features added to the project:
* HACK #4 Added a "Remember Me" check box to the login page. Passed a 3 minute time out when remember me is not checked. Changed remember me timeout to 1 day.
* HACK #5 Validated email/password on login page. Print error to console if "Invalid username and/or password"
* HACK #6 Validated email, check for duplicate email on sign up page. Print error to console "Email already in user by another registered user "
* HACK #7 Validated passwords match on create login page. Print error to console "Please provide matching passwords"
* HACK #8 Displayed logged in User on top of CRUD Page
* Hack #9 Added login/logout to navbar
* Hack #10 Automatically log out previously logged in user at the login screen
* Hack #11 Identify "anonymous" username on CRUD Page if no longer logged in

## Future Work
Based on Google searching I think these require javascript to modify the html pages? Need some help.
* Navbar grey options that do not apply with .css and javascript (hard!)
* Add lock symbol to menu items when running as anonymous (more hard javascript and .css / html )
